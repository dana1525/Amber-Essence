00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,360
Today we're going to talk about five of

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,040
the most popular ways to mix cocktails.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,001
Shaking, double shaking, stirring,

4
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:08,281
building, and blending. In this episode,

5
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:09,561
I'm going to try and help you understand

6
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,841
which technique you use when you're

7
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:12,841
making certain drinks, the impact it has

8
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,282
on the drink, and also give you some

9
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:15,762
examples of drinks that use each

10
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:18,082
technique. So let's have a look at it.

11
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:28,483
So before we get into those five

12
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,963
different methods of mixing drinks, we're

13
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,363
going to talk about why exactly you would

14
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,043
do this. And there are three primary

15
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,164
reasons. Number one is to mix the

16
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:37,804
ingredients together, #2 is to chill the

17
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,284
drink, and #3 is to bring some dilution

18
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:41,684
to the drink. Whichever method you go

19
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:42,925
for, you need to be quite intentional

20
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,245
with because it's going to have a big

21
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,525
impact on the texture of the drink

22
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,365
primarily. So first of all, we're going

23
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:48,245
to talk about shaking.

24
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:52,646
So when it comes to shaking a cocktail,

25
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:53,886
there are a few things you really need to

26
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,606
think about. First of all, you want to

27
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:57,566
make sure you use plenty of ice. Even

28
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:58,966
though it seems kind of contradictory,

29
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:00,926
using more ice actually gives you a

30
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,967
slower dilution because the drink stays

31
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,487
nice and cold. Whereas if you just add

32
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:05,687
one or two ice cubes, they're going to

33
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,127
melt pretty quickly and they're actually

34
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:08,327
going to dilute the drink before you

35
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:09,607
reach the texture you're looking for.

36
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:11,848
Again, whichever shaker you go for, make

37
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:13,248
sure you seal the two together nice and

38
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,848
tight, and you want to hold onto it with

39
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:17,568
two hands, one hand on top, one hand

40
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,768
underneath, and when you shake. There are

41
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:21,369
many different ways to shake a cocktail,

42
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:23,369
and the evidence seems to suggest that

43
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,249
whichever way you go for can be greatly

44
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:26,849
effective, as long as you shake it for

45
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:29,209
around about 12 to 15 seconds. So if you

46
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,330
want to read more about this, you can

47
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,650
read Liquid Intelligence, which does a

48
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,850
lot of work into this, but fundamentally

49
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,250
plenty of headroom. Shake it really hard

50
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,210
end to end and make sure the ice has

51
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,091
plenty of room to travel and the drink

52
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,771
also goes up and down through the shaker.

53
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:43,771
You don't want to go side to side because

54
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,811
it's just kind of going all over the

55
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,651
place without really mixing. You want to

56
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,892
use the full capacity of the shaker to

57
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,932
get as much back and forth as you

58
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:53,692
possibly can in the drink. The same

59
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:54,972
applies for your kind of three piece

60
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:57,252
shaker. Top and bottom. Make sure you

61
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,613
hold on nice and tight so you don't have

62
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:01,253
any spillages. Shake, shake, shake. Could

63
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:03,853
be a kind of up and down, could be a over

64
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:05,853
the shoulder, could be straight back and

65
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:07,614
forward. But it has to feel comfortable,

66
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:10,254
has to get the job done and shake nice

67
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:12,454
and hard. Really important. However you

68
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,654
shake, shake hard. But when would you do

69
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:17,215
this?So. These are kind of rules of

70
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,855
thumb. They're made to be broken, but

71
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,095
they're also there for a particular

72
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,495
reason. So shaking a cocktail is usually

73
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:23,855
done when there's citrus in the drink,

74
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:25,495
when there's dairy in the drink, or when

75
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:26,976
you want to really aerate the drink to

76
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:28,656
get it nice and vibrant and bubbly and

77
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,976
foamy and alive. So this is found in lots

78
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,336
of different cocktails. Daiquiri, Last

79
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,216
Word, Paper Plain. These are all shaken

80
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:36,257
cocktails because they all contain

81
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,017
citrus. But if you want to take this one

82
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,937
step further and get even more texture on

83
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:41,457
your drink, you can do what's called a

84
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:42,177
double shake.

85
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,658
So one of the key variations of shake in

86
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:48,418
a cocktail is called a double shake, and

87
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,578
this incorporates a dry shake. So rather

88
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:51,858
than just shaking the drink once with

89
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:53,218
ice, you're actually going to do 2

90
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:55,459
shakes, once with ice and once without

91
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,819
either dry first or dry second. If you do

92
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,259
the dry shake first, where you just shake

93
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,259
the cocktail to kind of emulsify it, that

94
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,260
would be a dry shake. Whereas if you do

95
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,260
it after the main shake with ice, that's

96
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,500
a reverse dry shake. So both of these

97
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,340
work really well. Experiment with both.

98
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,420
But when I talked about emulsification,

99
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,141
that's kind of important here because

100
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,021
it's going to be used when you

101
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,781
incorporate things like egg white or

102
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:19,061
aquafaba or even pineapple juice. You can

103
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:20,261
use this technique in drinks which is

104
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,901
sour based, like a whiskey sour or a

105
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,942
Pisco sour or even something like a white

106
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,462
lady. I actually try and avoid this

107
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:26,942
process as much as possible because it is

108
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,342
a little bit fiddly. If you're using

109
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,662
things like pineapple juice, egg white

110
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:31,302
and aquafaba, you do want that really

111
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,543
foamy texture. But if you also use ice

112
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:35,343
that's fresh out of the freezer, you can

113
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,063
just give it a single really hard shake

114
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:39,383
over ice and. Avoid the need to do this.

115
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:40,543
But if your ice has been out of the

116
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:42,064
freezer a little bit longer, you might

117
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:43,384
want to do this so you don't shake it too

118
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:45,664
hard and overly dilute the drink. So now

119
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:47,224
we've got a shake, we've got a double

120
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:48,824
shake. We can talk about stirring

121
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:49,344
cocktails.

122
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,585
So if you're making a drink that doesn't

123
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,345
contain citrus or it's almost entirely

124
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,065
booze, you might want to stir the drink.

125
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:58,425
And this doesn't add anywhere near as

126
00:03:58,425 --> 00:03:59,985
much aeration as you're shaking and

127
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:02,026
double shaking. It's kind of silkier,

128
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:04,826
more refined, a little bit smoother, but

129
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:06,826
equally powerful. So you do this when

130
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,106
you're making drinks like a. Martini, as

131
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:10,987
long as it's not a shaken martini, a

132
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,907
Manhattan, a Martinez and an old

133
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:14,387
fashioned. And if you think about the

134
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,627
texture of those drinks, they're very

135
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:18,307
elegant, very silky, not kind of

136
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:19,707
vibrant and alive, which is what you're

137
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:20,908
going to get with a shaken drink. So

138
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:22,108
again, the technique for this can be

139
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:23,788
really simple. You just want to stir the

140
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,628
drink down over lots of ice, using a bar

141
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:27,308
spoon ideally, but also a chopstick might

142
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,988
work. And then once you reach the level

143
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:30,829
of dilution you're looking for, strain it

144
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,829
out and you'll get that really nice silky

145
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,509
cocktail. This retains a lot of really

146
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,189
nice aromatics of the drink, but also it

147
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:37,949
gives a really nice kind of clear final

148
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,350
drink, which obviously if you're shaking

149
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,590
the drink, you're going to aerate it and

150
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,190
lose that. So now we've got our shaken

151
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,830
drinks, our double shaken drinks and our

152
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,070
stirred drinks. We're going to look at

153
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,950
building drinks.

154
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,191
So when it comes to building drinks, what

155
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,791
this means is building the drink in the

156
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,711
glass. Something like a mojito would be a

157
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,551
really good example of this or any drink

158
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,631
that you're going to top with something

159
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,312
like soda water. Tonic or even sparkling

160
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,032
wine. And the reason to do this is to

161
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,512
avoid overly diluting the drink or to

162
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,872
keep the entire pieces of fruit, herbs or

163
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,353
spices in the final drink. So when it

164
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:09,513
comes to the mojito, you're actually

165
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:10,873
muddling the mint into the drink and

166
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,433
leaving it in there. But you do have to

167
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,633
be careful that if you're building in the

168
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,193
drink, you don't break the glass when you

169
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:16,634
muddle too hard. So now we're going to

170
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:17,954
talk about the final technique today,

171
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:19,074
which is going to be blending.

172
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:23,434
So a final technique we can look at,

173
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,754
which is featured in things like a pina

174
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:26,755
colada and all sorts of frozen cocktails,

175
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,955
is going to be blending drinks. And this

176
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,155
is really useful if you want to leave the

177
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:32,355
entire fruit in the drink or to get that

178
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:35,155
kind of really nice blended, smooth,

179
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,836
almost creamy texture. If you can add

180
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,796
something like coconut milk or cream. And

181
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,356
it's just a really interesting way to do

182
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:41,716
things where you actually blend the ice

183
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:43,476
completely into the drink rather than

184
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,357
straining it out. So when it comes to

185
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:46,837
adding ice, if you add a little bit of

186
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:48,757
ice, you'll get a kind of almost

187
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,597
milkshake texture, whereas if you add a

188
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,277
lot of ice, it'll become very thick,

189
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:54,398
almost like a slushy. So there's no right

190
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,958
and wrong here. I prefer it a little bit

191
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,238
on the looser side so you can at least.

192
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,718
Drink it rather than eating it, but your

193
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,558
mileage may vary. If you like disco

194
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,078
drinks, you might like them to be kind of

195
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:04,919
slushy drinks, which is totally fine.

196
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,479
Barlic to get a little bit lighter, a

197
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,999
little bit more pourable, a little bit

198
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,479
more sippable, and we'll see a pina

199
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,839
colada in the future, which I'm very

200
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,159
excited to share with you. So now I've

201
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:13,800
got really good foundation to build upon.

202
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,640
We've covered some essential bottles,

203
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,040
some essential tools, the importance of

204
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,680
balance, sweetening drinks, seasoning

205
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
drinks, all sorts of ways of presenting

206
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,361
the drinks, including ice, clear ice,

207
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,121
garnishes. I think we're pretty much

208
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,721
ready to start mixing some cocktails.
